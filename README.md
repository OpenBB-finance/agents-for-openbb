# Bring your own Agent to the OpenBB Workspace

Welcome to the example repository for integrating custom agents into the OpenBB Workspace.

This repository provides everything you need to build and add your own custom
agents that are compatible with the OpenBB Workspace.

It depends heavily on the [OpenBB AI SDK](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/openbb-ai).

For documentation on how to use the OpenBB AI SDK (highly recommended!), see the [OpenBB AI SDK README](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/openbb-ai).

## Examples
If you prefer diving straight into code, we have a growing list of examples of
custom agents in this repository, varying in complexity and features:

- [A vanilla agent that retrieves raw widget data](./30-vanilla-agent-raw-widget-data)
- [A vanilla agent that yields reasoning steps to OpenBB Workspace](./31-vanilla-agent-reasoning-steps)
- [A vanilla agent that can retrieve data from OpenBB Workspace and produce citations](./32-vanilla-agent-raw-widget-data-citations)
- [A vanilla agent that can produce charts](./33-vanilla-agent-charts)
- [A vanilla agent that can produce tables](./34-vanilla-agent-tables)
- [A vanilla agent that can handle PDF data](./35-vanilla-agent-pdf)

These examples are a good starting point for building your own custom agent if
you are interested in a specific feature or use case.
